# It's time for me to reintroduce myself

My name is Will Kelly. I’m a [product marketer and writer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willkelly/) passionate about content's role in technology adoption and moving enterprise deals forward. 

I got my start as a technical writer. It’s a profession that taught me a lot about people and how people and technology come together as a solution to resolve customer pain points. It was a job I enjoyed but grew out of as a professional as I got more involved in cloud strategy, persona development, messaging, competitive research, white papers, and more marketing content. I found a new passion and challenges leading me to pivot into marketing. 

My value as a product marketer comes from seeing technology adoption through multiple lenses. I spent much of my career on client-facing project teams, so I’ve seen pain points and know the significant personas firsthand. Writing about DevOps and cloud taught me another side of the industry from my corporate work. Carrying your own byline means there’s nobody to hide behind. I also got to speak to and learn from people and stakeholders I would never have met during my day job. 
 
I’m in the job market for a new position as a Senior Product Marketing Manager or Content Marketing Manager. I’m also open to hearing about the right Principal Writer role too. 


# My personal productivity stack

Most of my career has been spent on content creation. First, as a technical writer, then [freelance writer](https://willkelly.cloud/published-work/), and now it’s a huge part of my marketing job. Here is my personal productivity stack:

## Google Workspace

I spent the majority of my technical writing career using Microsoft Office. Then I worked for a company that uses [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) as its productivity suite. Even before my recent job change, I was using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) on an increasing basis for personal writing projects.

Regularly, I find myself reviewing and editing content using Google Docs and Google Slides iOS apps.

## Hey

My personal Gmail account became pretty useless during the last few months of 2020 because of spam. The Gmail web UI and I have never been on the best of terms either. I’ve been quietly switching my personal email over to [Hey](https://hey.com/). So far, I use it only for select personal communications and don’t advertise the email address broadly.

## Todoist

Personally, I’m more organized electronically than I’ve ever been using paper. [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is my task list of choice for the past few years and a key part of my productivity tools. It lets me create templates for editorial checklists and [Doist](https://doist.com/) (the company behind Todoist) launched a site of templates. I have yet to try out their [Twist](https://twist.com/) asynchronous communication tool. Though I have been following their thought leadership writing about asynchronous communication and remote teams.

## Automattic P2

I’ve written about [Automattic P2](https://wordpress.com/p2/) elsewhere and I had some success using it to track some personal branding and other job-hunting minutiae earning it a place in my personal productivity stack.

## Trello

I’ve had success using [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) in the past to manage editorial calendars and [content publishing](https://willkelly.medium.com/using-trello-for-managing-editorial-projects-db27f78cac29). It remains one of my go to tools when I need to communicate publishing processes and timelines to product and engineering management.

## LucidChart

I’m a Visio guy from way back when. I still like it as an application. Lucid, developers of LucidChart and now Lucidspark, got the online collaboration part of diagramming down early in the game. LucidChart had it down well before [Visio Online](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/03/01/visio-online-anywhere-anytime-access-to-your-diagrams/) in fact.

LucidChart also has a solid iOS app that I’ve used to edit diagrams on an iPad Pro.
