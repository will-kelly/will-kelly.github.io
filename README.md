My name is Will Kelly. I’m a product marketer and writer passionate about content's role in technology adoption and moving enterprise deals forward. 

I got my start as a technical writer. It’s a profession that taught me a lot about people and how people and technology come together as a solution to resolve customer pain points. It was a job I enjoyed but grew out of as a professional as I got more involved in cloud strategy, persona development, messaging, competitive research, white papers, and more marketing content. I found a new passion and challenges leading me to pivot into marketing. 

My value as a product marketer comes from seeing technology adoption through multiple lenses. I spent much of my career on client-facing project teams, so I’ve seen pain points and know the significant personas firsthand. Writing about DevOps and cloud taught me another side of the industry from my corporate work. Carrying your own byline means there’s nobody to hide behind. I also got to speak to and learn from people and stakeholders I would never have met during my day job. 
 
I’m in the job market for a new position as a Senior Product Marketing Manager or Content Marketing Manager. I’m also open to hearing about the right Principal Writer role too.
